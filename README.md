This project is a **Handwritten Digit Recognizer** that uses deep learning to predict digits from images of handwritten numbers. The application allows you to upload an image in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format and automatically predicts the digit using a neural network.

## Features

- **Digit Recognition**: Upload an image of a handwritten digit, and the model predicts the number.
- **Image Upload**: Supports common image formats like `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png`.
- **Neural Network**: Powered by a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset.
- **Libraries Used**: Built using `TensorFlow` and `Keras` for deep learning.

## Dataset

The model was trained using the popular [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow**: Used for building and training the neural network model.
- **Keras**: Leveraged for simplified neural network layers and model training.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used to develop this project.
- **OpenCV** (optional): For pre-processing images, if necessary.

## How to Use

1. Upload an image of a handwritten digit (either in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format).
2. The model processes the image and outputs the predicted digit.
3. View the predicted result directly in the application interface.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and follow the installation steps below.
